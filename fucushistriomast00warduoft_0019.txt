INTRODUCTION xv

‘Prologus Posterior' to the attempt to suppress Loiola two years
before (if that reference is indeed there) would now be somewhat
out of date.

It seems therefore more probable that Fucus, having been
first acted before the University like Loiola in February 162}
was acted again in the following month before the King at
Newmarket. We know that in March 161} King James had
a play ‘by some of the younger sons of our Cantabrigians,’ as
Chamberlain writes, acted before him at Royst0n1.

THE PLAY.

The origin of the play Fucus is probably to be seen in the
indignation of the play-loving author at the Puritan attempt to
prevent the performance of Loiola. The consequence was a
savage picture of Puritan hypocrisy, in the person of Fucus
Histriomastix‚ who while secretly vicious and pleasure-loving
carries on a warfare against the academie drama as he has done
previously against popular ballads, bagpipes‚ dancing‚ wine-
bibbing, saints’ days and maypoles. The character, which may
have been suggested by that of some actual person unknown to
uS, recalls that of Busy in Jonson's Bartholomew Fair (1614)
who ‘sitteth here to prophesy the destruction of fairs and
May-games, wakes and Whitsun-ales’ and considers ‘your
stage-players, rimers and morrice-dancers’ as ‘a beam in the
eye '—or Martinus in Loiola itself.

Martinus shares Fucus' dislike of church festivals. At the
words ‘tuus festus dies,' he remonstrates ‘Mulier‚ quid ais?
