’ woman), who taking a cushion in hand, dances about the room

and at the end of the tune, stops and sings ’- This dance it will
no further go.² The musician answers ‘I pray you, good Sir,
why say you so?’—Man.· ‘Because Joan Sanderson will not
come too.’—Musician .· ‘ She must corne too and she shall come
too, and she must come whether she will or no.' Then he lays
down the cushion before the woman, on which she kneels, and
he kisses her, singing ‘Welcome, Joan Sanderson, welcome, wel-
come.' Then she rises, takes up the cushion, and both dance,
singing ‘Prinkum-prankum is a fine dance‚ and shall we go
dance it once again, once again, and once again, and shall we
go dance it once again.’ Then making a stop the woman sings
as before ‘This dance it will no further go.'—Musician: ‘I pray
you, Madam, why say you so ? ²—W oman .· ‘Because John Sander-
son will not come too.’-—Musician.· ‘He must corne too, and he
shall come t00, and he must come whether he will or no.’ ν
And so she lays down the cushion before a man, who kneeling
upon it salutes her3 she singing ‘welcome, John Sanderson,
welcome, welcome.' Then, he taking up the cushion, they take
hands and dance round, singing as before. And thus they do
till the whole company are taken into the ring; and if there is
company enough, make a little ring in its middle, and within
that ring, set a chair, and lay the cushion in it, and the first
man set in it. Then the cushion is laid before the first man,
the woman singing ‘This dance it will no further go,' and as
before, only instead of ‘Come too,’ they sing ‘Go fro,' and
instead of ‘Welcome, John Sanderson,’ they sing ‘F arewell,
John Sanderson, farewell, farewell '3 and so they go out one by
one as they came in. Note. The women are kissed by all the men
