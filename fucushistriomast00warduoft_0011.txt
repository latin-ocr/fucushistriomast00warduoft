INTRODUCTION

Ι. DATE AND PLACE oF PRODUCTION.

THE ORIGINAL CAST.

THE play is preserved to us in two MSS, one (L) belonging
to the Library of Lambeth Palace1, the other (O) to the
Bodleian Library‚ Oxford ². The Oxford MS is more carefully
written—but the Lambeth MS represents apparently the text
as revised for the performance before the Kingss, and in spite of
its gross errors, due apparently to the ignorance of the scribe
and necessitating a long list of corrections, has been taken as
the basis of the present edition. O gives as the title of the
play ‘F ucus sive Histriomastix⁴.'

Neither MS gives any direct information as to the author-
ship of the play, or the date5 or place of its production. The
two prologues show however that the play was acted once
before the University only, and a second time before the King,
and L gives a list of those who acted on one or other of these
occasions. The names which will be found with the list of

¹ No. 828. 2 Rawl. Poet. 21.
3 See 1. 6. 32-34 and textual notes ad loc.

4 Histriomastix was of course the title of a play printed in 1610.
⁵ See Textual Notes, ad fin.
