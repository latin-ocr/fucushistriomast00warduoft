xiv INTRODUCTION

clear that on this occasion he saw only the one play and
returned to Newmarket the same night1‚ and there is no
evidence of his having come over to Cambridge a second time.
It is possible that he did so3 if not, supposing Fucus to have been
acted before him shortly after its performance before the
University, the players must have journeyed to Newmarket and
performed there.

James’ next visit to Cambridge was in December 1624,
three months before his death. He was in bad health, but he
stayed in Trinity from some date between the 2nd and 12th
till the 17th or 18th. We are told of a visit paid by ‘the
French Ambassadors’ to see the King when Sir D. Carleton
says² ‘ There should have been a comedy, but the shortness of
the time, the King’s indisposition and their hasting away, cut
it off.' However there seems to be no reason why the King
should not have seen some comedies during the week or fort-
night he was in Cambridge. It was now however nearly two
years since Fusus had been first produced, and it seems hardly
likely that it should have been revived. The reference in the

Loiola, 1648. Nichols in his text (lv. 835) puts the visit on the 19th‚
misled by the publication, True copies of all tlte Latine orations ἅτε. (1623),
in which the Vice—chancellor's speech to the King is dated ⁴ 19th March.’
This is certainly an error.

¹ Letter of J. Chamberlain‚ March 21, 1623, in Birch's Court and
Times of James I. Chamberlain speaks only of ‘the play.' It lasted,
however, from 1 1 a.m. to 4 p.m.‚ and if not cut down would have taken
6 or 7 hours instead of 5. Does this suggest that two plays were given ?
If so, our difficulty disappears.
