INTRQDUCTION

Dramatis Personae on p. 1 are in the main those of members
of Qeens’ College, Cambridge, about 1623 or 1624, as will be
seen from the following probable identifications.

Sr Eales

Sr Potter

Stanino

Mr Beck

Tho. Eales (Warwick)‚ Qu.‚ B.A. 1623, Fellow

1622, Μ.Α. 1624, S.T.B. 1631.

Ric. Potter, Qu.‚ B.A. 1623, M.A. 1624,

S.T.B. 1632.

Jas. Stanino (Staninough, Stanninow) (London),

Qu.‚ adm. 30 Ap. 1622, mat. 4 July 1622,
B.A. 1623, Fellow 1628, Μ.Α. 1629.
In Sept. 1631 the College gave him ‘leave
to forbear to take orders' and this was
renewed 22 July 1 633 (Grosart, C rashaw’s
lVorks‚ 11. p. lviii.). He was buried in
Queens’ Coll. Chapel 5 March 1633.
An elegy on him by Richard Crashaw
is printed in Crashaw’s Works. Latin
and Greek verses by him are found in
the University collections of 1625 (‘Canta-
brigiensum dolor et solamen’ and ‘Epitha-
lamium ⁹) and in that of 1633 (‘Rex
Redux’).

As he acted a female part, probably not Wm.

Belke, Qu.‚ B.A. 1613, Μ.Α. 1622,
Fellow 1624, but Edw. Becke, Qu.‚
mat. as pensioner 5 July 1621, B.A.
162{, Μ.Α. 1627. The prefix ‘Mr’
is however hard to account for.
