Stratton Joh. Stratton, Qu.‚ mat. as pensioner 4 July
1620.

Bell Ric. Bell, Qu.‚ mat. as pensioner 13 Dec.
1622.

If the identifications are correct, there is some inconsistency
in the addition or omission of prefixes to the names. Clovile‚
Hausted and Higham took their degrees in the same year, 1622
yet Clovile is here designated as a bachelor‚ Hausted and Higham
as undergraduates. Probably Clovile’s degree is antedated. On
the whole the evidence based on the designations of the actors
would lead to the conclusion that the performance took place
between Ash Wednesday (the date of graduation) 1627} and the
same day of 1625}

Other evidence however goes to show that the first per-
formance of the play took place at a date very near to the
Bachelors’ Commencement of 162}².

A letter (endorsed ‘24 Jan. 1622,’ i.e. 162}) of William
Beale, Fellow of Jesus2, to William Boswell, Secretary to the
Lord Keeper, westminster, contains the following passage :—

‘Comoedia habenda est nouissime a nostratibus Jesuanis‚ et
iam scenae ornnes in Actu sunt quotidiano. Gemina Comoedia
in fieri est 3 nae quidem et in Agere, apud Trinitarios :
Autoribus Hacket, et Stubs: lepidis Jupiter, et comicissimis.

1 The President of Queens’ College kindly allowed me to examine the
bursarial accounts of the college. 1 found no reference to the performance
of this comedy, though there was an item in April 1623 ‘vpon the Kings
comming to Cambridg iiij¹i xii⁵ ixd.’

2 He became Master of Jesus in 1632 and Master of St John’s in 1633.
