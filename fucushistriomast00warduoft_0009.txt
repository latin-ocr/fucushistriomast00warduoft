PREFACE

MY thanks are due to His Grace the Archbishop

of Canterbury for permission to copy and print
the Lambeth MS. of the play, and to the Librarians of
Lambeth and the Bodleian for the hospitality accorded

to me in those libraries.

As in the case of Hymenaeus Ι have departed as little
as possible from the MS. adopted as the basis of the
edition. There are many lines which might be improved
from a metrical point of view, but considering the laxity
of the metrical canons recognised by Jacobean play-
wrightS‚ I have thought it safer—as well as more in
accordance with the directions Ι received from the
Syndicate of the Press—to abstain from corrections on
metrica] groundS.

G. C. M. S.
