rustics also have their triumph over F ucus, whom they hoist
and beat : and the marriage of Philomathes and Comoedia is to
be followed by that of Villanus and Ballada.

Villanus' snatches of song have attached to them in the
Lambeth MS their appropriate tunes. Some of the English
songs thus mentioned are well known : ‘As I went to
Walsingham‚’ ‘ F ortune my foe‚' ‘ As at noon Dulcina rested‚’
‘ O hon hananero‚’ ‘ The Earl of Essex his last good-night,' ‘If
Rosamund that was so fair.' Others however are mentioned,
which neither Ι nor some better scholars, whom I have consulted,
have been able to trace. Such are ‘ Ye ladies of the court, come
down and take your places‚' ‘ Come help me over the water, ye
bonny bonny boatman¹,' ‘Puppy has beaten saucy Jack,’ ‘To
the sun,' ‘To Rumford,’ ‘I love her that loves me, my humour
is such,’ ‘Thinkest that I am such a fool for to marry,’ ‘ La-
ment‚ bagpipe‚ lament.’

The ‘ Cushion-dance ' or ‘John Sanderson ’ (‘ saltemus cum
pulvino...Johannem Sandersonum' 1v. 2. 18-20) indulged in
contrary to their principles by Fucus and his precisian brothers
and sisters, is fully described by Chappell in his Popular Music
of the Olden Time (p. 153, &c.). He gives the tune from
The Dancing Master of 1686 and the following description from

the same:
‘This dance is begun by a single person (either man or

1 Among some ‘ Dramatic Pieces' in Add. MSS 23‚723 we find ‘The
Poules Complainte to the tune of Bonny Boateman ’ (c. 1619) ; and
Chappell, ‘Popular Music, gives the tune ‘ Boatman’ from collections of
1650 and 1661, but says he has not discovered the words. His tune is a
‘ bagpipe tune ' and would fit our words.
