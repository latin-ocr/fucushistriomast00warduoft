The arguments for and against play-acting here introduced seem to be
borrowed from those used in the Rainolds-Gager controversy (on which
see an article by Mr F. S. Boas in the Fortnzglctly Review, Aug. 1907).
Gager had himself at the end of his play Ulysses Redux (printed 1592)
put the arguments against the stage in the mouth of Momus, and then
answered them. Rainolds in his Ouertlzrow qutage-playes (1599) deals
with these answers. The author of Fucus seems not to have used
Gager’s play directly, but to have taken his points on both sides from
such passages as the following in Rainolds’ book.

P. 4: the Praetor...saith...1nfamia notatur qui artis ludicrae pronun-
tiandive causa in scenam prodierit. And Ulpian...doeth report him so...
Ait Praetor, Qui in scenam prodierit infamis est.

P. 8: the lawe of God...forbiddeth a man to put on womans
raiment...you answer that it is not vnlawfull simply and alwayes.

P. 55, note 3 (quoted from Gager): Non ergo vestis foeminea iuveni
est scelus, Sed prava mens &c-

note 7 (quoted from Gager): N ec habitus vllus‚ sed animus turpem
facit.

P. 73: you denie that you who corne on the stage once in a yeare
or two, in seauen, or in tenne, or sometime twentie yeares, are to be
termed stage-players.

P. 101: if it be true [quoting Gager] that wearing implieth a
custome and a common vse of so doeing [with reference to the wearing
of woman's clothes].

P. 17: the third reason wherein playes are charged...not fot
making young men come forth in hoores attire...but for teaching them
to counterfeit her actions. her wauton kisse, her impudent face, her
wieked speeches and entisements.
