’ The last comedy mentioned by Dr Beale was surely Fucus:
while the Trinity play ‘by Hacket and Stubs' was doubtless
Laida, acted before the University on Feb. 28th and before
King James on the 12th March 162}². There had been an
attempt to strangle this play at its birth, as we learn from a letter
of John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton‚ dated London,
Feb. 22, 162}

‘Boschet3‚ the Ambassador from the Archduchess,...lodgeth
with the Spanish ambassador, refusing to be defrayed, as was
intended, and that he should have had his audience at Cam-

¹ State Papus, Domestic, Addenda, 1580—1625, xliii. 1. The abstract
of the letter in the calendar is far from accurate. Dr Beale says that in
his own college, JesuS, a comedy was shortly to be performed and was
already being rehearsed daily: that at Trinity a comedy (‘twin’ with that
at Jesus) by Hacket and stubs was already being rehearsed: and that
another comedy was to be ‘ hammered out ‘ and ‘ hatched ’ by one Ward,
a Master of Arts (and of witty arts) of Queens’ College.

2 Hacket's biographer, Plume (1675), says that Hacket wrote Loiola in
a month‚ in 1616 (apparently), when staying in Notts. Possibly Edmund
Stubbe‚ the author of Fraus Honesta (acted 1613), adapted the play for
representation in ιόῑξ, Hacket having by this time other things to think
about.

³ Should be ‘Boiscot.’
